# Data Manipulation Library
For Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames

This library serves no purpose other than to wrap common Numpy and Pandas
operations in a single interface. Basically I got tired of thinking about
if I had/needed a Numpy array or a Dataframe, and I wanted to not think
about it anymore.

The wrapper functions here allow you to go back and forth between Numpy and
Dataframes as needed, along with a few more interesting functions like
make_timeseries() and normalize() (which will also scale).

Still adding things as I think of them.
